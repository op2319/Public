HI! My name is Omkar and I am an aspiring Data Analyst. This Respotitory contains an archive of all of the previous personal projects that I have done, everything from my work as an undergradute researcher at university to my personal projects with datasets in SQL and Python. I hope to continue to document and record all of my work as best as I can. Thanks for checking this out!! 

TESLa-codes: This Project records all that I have done with the Turbulence and Energy Systems Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder. The primary work that I was doing was conducting research on the behavior of Interacting Buoyant Plumes, employing computational methods to do so. Attached is all of the code and datasets that I had used and created to achieve those goals.
